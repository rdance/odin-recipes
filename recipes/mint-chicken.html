    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless,boneless chicken breast halves-cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic,crushed</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup margarine</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
